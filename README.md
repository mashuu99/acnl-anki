## Description
I created this Anki deck while playing *Animal Crossing: New Leaf* on the 3DS! It's still a work in progress, as I’m actively playing the game and adding new cards as I progress. This deck includes words, sentences, occasional items, and more from the game. Please note that while I’ve included words of all levels—not just the difficult ones—I may have skipped some very common words along the way.

✔️ All cards include Furigana readings on the example sentences.  
💬 Every word has a definition in English, and sometimes in French as well.

### Further Details:
*   All cards use a slightly modified version of the Anime Cards template.
*   Some cards include multiple example sentences; just click on the card to view the next one.
*   Occasionally, the picture or example sentence may be missing because I forgot to take a screenshot. I’ll fix these as soon as I come across the word again in the game.
