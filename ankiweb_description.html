I created this Anki deck while playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf on the 3DS! It's still WIP, as I‚Äôm actively playing the game and adding new cards as I progress. This deck includes words, sentences, occasional items, and more from the game. Please note that while I‚Äôve included words of all levels‚Äînot just the difficult ones‚ÄîI may have skipped some very common words along the way.

‚úîÔ∏è All cards include Furigana readings on the example sentences<br>
üí¨ Every word has a definition in English, and sometimes in French as well.

Further Details :
<strike>- All cards use a modified version of the <a href="https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/151553357">Anime Cards</a> template.</strike>
- All cards use a modified version of the <a href="https://github.com/rudnam/JP-study">Mining-JP / JP-Study</a> template.
- Some cards include multiple example sentences, just click on the card to view the next one.
- Occasionally, the picture or example sentence may be missing because I forgot to take a screenshot. I‚Äôll fix these as soon as I come across the word again in the game.
